# FlexOffer

FlexOffer messages are used by AGRs to make DSOs an offer for provision of flexibility.
A FlexOffer message contains a list of ISPs and, for each ISP, the change in consumption or production offered and the price for the total amount of flexibility offered.
FlexOffer messages can be sent once a FlexRequest message has been received but can also be sent unsolicited.
Note that multiple FlexOffer messages may be sent based on a single FlexRequest, e.g. to increase the chance that the DSO will order at least part of its available flexibility.
The AGR must make sure that it can actually provide the flexibility offered across all of its FlexOffers.

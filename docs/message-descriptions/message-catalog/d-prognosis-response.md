# D-PrognosisResponse

Upon receiving and processing a prognosis message, the receiving implementation must reply with a D-PrognosisResponse, indicating whether the prognosis was syntactically and semantically valid, and, where any FlexOrder messages have previously been sent for any ISP in the period the prognosis applies to, a FlexOrderStatus indication for each of those orders.

| Result             | Indication whether the prognosis was accepted or rejected. A receiving implementation may reject a prognosis if it's syntactically invalid, uses a ISP duration or time zone that deviates from what is agreed upon for the market, is for a unknown Congestion Point or from an AGR that is not listed in the Common Reference, does not contain a full list of ISPs for the Period it applies to, contains implausible power values, applies to a Period for which all ISPs are already pending settlement, or if a Prognosis of the same type and from the same originator with a higher sequence number was already processed previously. |
| RejectionReason    | In case the update was rejected, this attribute must contain a human-readable description of the failure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

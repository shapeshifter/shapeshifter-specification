# FlexOrder

FlexOrder messages are used by DSOs to purchase flexibility from an AGR based on a previous FlexOffer.
A FlexOrder message contains a list of ISPs, with, for each ISP, the change in consumption or production to be realized by the AGR, and the accepted price to be paid by the DSO for this amount of flexibility.
This ISP list should be copied from the FlexOffer message without modification: AGR implementations will (and must) reject FlexOrder messages where the ISP list is not exactly the same as offered.

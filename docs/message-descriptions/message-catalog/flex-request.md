# FlexRequest

FlexRequest messages are used by DSOs to request flexibility from AGRs.
In addition to one or more ISP elements with Disposition=Requested, indicating the actual need to reduce consumption or production, the message should also include the remaining ISPs for the current period where Disposition=Available.

# Settle phase

The informative description of the settle phase processes are provided in [Settle phase](../../general-description/settle-phase.md).
In this chapter, the use cases will be described, as derived from the settle phase.

The USEF MCM settle phase specifies the following use case:

### Related information

If settlement items are missing, the message should be rejected (as mentioned in failure outcome).
This is to encourage sending of all required information necessary to settle trades as soon as possible, thereby avoiding a series of unsettled trades for a given period.

Note that the rejection of a FlexSettlement message is not a means of raising a dispute for settlement items.
The dispute process is out-of-scope for USEF.

## USEF Flex Trading Protocol 

The Universal Smart Energy Framework (USEF) has been developed to drive a fast, fair and lowest cost route to an integrated smart energy 
future. By delivering one common standard, it enables cost-efficient connectivity of all smart energy projects and technologies. Its 
market structure, roles, rules and tools for the commoditization and trading of flexible energy usage work with existing energy markets.  

The USEF Flex Trading protocol (UFTP) is a subset of the USEF framework. Focused specifically on the exchange of flexibility between 
Aggregators (AGRs) and DSOs, it describes the corresponding market interactions between them to resolve grid constraints by applying 
congestion management or grid-capacity management. UFTP can be used as a stand-alone protocol for flexibility forecasting, offering, 
ordering, and settlement processes. 

UFTP and the USEF Framework are developed, maintained and audited by the USEF Foundation.

The directory name of each set of XSDs refer to the corresponding version of USEF Flexibility Trading Protocol Specifications as published
by the [USEF Foundation](https://www.usef.energy/).
